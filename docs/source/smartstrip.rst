Smart strips
============


.. note::

    The emeter feature is currently not implemented for smart strips. See https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa/issues/64 for details.

.. note::

    Feel free to open a pull request to improve the documentation!

Command-line usage
******************

To command a single socket of a strip, you will need to specify it either by using ``--index`` or by using ``--name``.
If not specified, the commands will act on the parent device: turning the strip off will turn off all sockets.

**Example:** Turn off the first socket (the indexing starts from zero):

.. code::

   $ kasa --strip --host <host> on --index 0

**Example:** Turn on the socket by name:

.. code::

   $ kasa --strip --host <host> off --name "Maybe Kitchen"
