Command-line usage
==================

The package is shipped with a console tool named kasa, please refer to ``kasa --help`` for detailed usage.
The device to which the commands are sent is chosen by ``KASA_HOST`` environment variable or passing ``--host <address>`` as an option.
To see what is being sent to and received from the device, specify option ``--debug``.

To avoid discovering the devices when executing commands its type can be passed as an option (e.g., ``--plug`` for plugs, ``--bulb`` for bulbs, ..).
If no type is manually given, its type will be discovered automatically which causes a short delay.

If no command is given, the ``state`` command will be executed to query the device state.

.. note::

    Some commands (such as reading energy meter values, changing bulb settings, or accessing individual sockets on smart strips) additional parameters are required,
    which you can find by adding ``--help`` after the command, e.g. ``kasa emeter --help`` or ``kasa hsv --help``.
    Refer to the device type specific documentation for more details.


Provisioning
************

You can provision your device without any extra apps by using the ``kasa wifi`` command:

1. If the device is unprovisioned, connect to its open network
2. Use ``kasa discover`` (or check the routes) to locate the IP address of the device (likely 192.168.0.1, if unprovisioned)
3. Scan for available networks using ``kasa --host 192.168.0.1 wifi scan`` see which networks are visible to the device
4. Join/change the network using ``kasa --host 192.168.0.1 wifi join <network to join>``

As with all other commands, you can also pass ``--help`` to both ``join`` and ``scan`` commands to see the available options.
