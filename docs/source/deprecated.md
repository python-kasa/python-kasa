# Deprecated API

```{currentmodule} kasa
```
The page contains the documentation for the deprecated library API that only works with the older kasa devices.

If you want to continue to use the old API for older devices,
you can use the classes in the `iot` module to avoid deprecation warnings.

```py
from kasa.iot import IotDevice, IotBulb, IotPlug, IotDimmer, IotStrip, IotLightStrip
```


```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 2

smartdevice
smartbulb
smartplug
smartdimmer
smartstrip
smartlightstrip
```
