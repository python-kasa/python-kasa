python-kasa is a Python library to control TPLink's smart home devices (plugs, wall switches, power strips, and bulbs).

This is a voluntary, community-driven effort and is not affiliated, sponsored, or endorsed by TPLink.

**Contributions in any form (adding missing features, reporting issues, fixing or triaging existing ones, improving the documentation, or device donations) are more than welcome!**

---

## Getting started

You can install the most recent release using pip:
```
pip install python-kasa
```

If you are using cpython, it is recommended to install with `[speedups]` to enable orjson (faster json support):
```
pip install python-kasa[speedups]
```

With `[speedups]`, the protocol overhead is roughly an order of magnitude lower (benchmarks available in devtools).

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and use poetry to install the development version:
```
git clone https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa.git
cd python-kasa/
poetry install
```

If you have not yet provisioned your device, [you can do so using the cli tool](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#provisioning).

## Discovering devices

Running `kasa discover` will send discovery packets to the default broadcast address (`255.255.255.255`) to discover supported devices.
If your system has multiple network interfaces, you can specify the broadcast address using the `--target` option.

The `discover` command will automatically execute the `state` command on all the discovered devices:

```
$ kasa discover
Discovering devices on 255.255.255.255 for 3 seconds

```

If your device requires authentication to control it,
you need to pass the credentials using `--username` and `--password` options.

## Basic functionalities

All devices support a variety of common commands, including:

* `state` which returns state information
* `on` and `off` for turning the device on or off
* `emeter` (where applicable) to return energy consumption information
* `sysinfo` to return raw system information

The syntax to control device is `kasa --host <ip address> <command>`.
Use `kasa --help` ([or consult the documentation](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#kasa-help)) to get a list of all available commands and options.
Some examples of available options include JSON output (`--json`), defining timeouts (`--timeout` and `--discovery-timeout`).

Each individual command may also have additional options, which are shown when called with the `--help` option.
For example, `--transition` on bulbs requests a smooth state change, while `--name` and `--index` are used on power strips to select the socket to act on:

```
$ kasa on --help

Usage: kasa on [OPTIONS]

  Turn the device on.

Options:
  --index INTEGER
  --name TEXT
  --transition INTEGER
  --help                Show this message and exit.
```


### Bulbs

Common commands for bulbs and light strips include:

* `brightness` to control the brightness
* `hsv` to control the colors
* `temperature` to control the color temperatures

When executed without parameters, these commands will report the current state.

Some devices support `--transition` option to perform a smooth state change.
For example, the following turns the light to 30% brightness over a period of five seconds:
```
$ kasa --host <addr> brightness --transition 5000 30
```

See `--help` for additional options and [the documentation](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartbulb.html) for more details about supported features and limitations.

### Power strips

Each individual socket can be controlled separately by passing `--index` or `--name` to the command.
If neither option is defined, the commands act on the whole power strip.

For example:
```
$ kasa --host <addr> off  # turns off all sockets
$ kasa --host <addr> off --name 'Socket1'  # turns off socket named 'Socket1'
```

See `--help` for additional options and [the documentation](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartstrip.html) for more details about supported features and limitations.


## Energy meter

Running `kasa emeter` command will return the current consumption.
Possible options include `--year` and `--month` for retrieving historical state,
and reseting the counters can be done with `--erase`.

```
$ kasa emeter
== Emeter ==
Current state: {'total': 133.105, 'power': 108.223577, 'current': 0.54463, 'voltage': 225.296283}
```

# Library usage

If you want to use this library in your own project, a good starting point is to check [the documentation on discovering devices](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discover.html).
You can find several code examples in the API documentation of each of the implementation base classes, check out the [documentation for the base class shared by all supported devices](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartdevice.html).

[The library design and module structure is described in a separate page](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design.html).

The device type specific documentation can be found in their separate pages:
* [Plugs](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartplug.html)
* [Bulbs](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartbulb.html)
* [Dimmers](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartdimmer.html)
* [Power strips](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartstrip.html)
* [Light strips](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smartlightstrip.html)

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! To simplify the process, we are leveraging automated checks and tests for contributions.

### Setting up development environment

To get started, simply clone this repository and initialize the development environment.
We are using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management, so after cloning the repository simply execute
`poetry install` which will install all necessary packages and create a virtual environment for you.

### Code-style checks

We use several tools to automatically check all contributions. The simplest way to verify that everything is formatted properly
before creating a pull request, consider activating the pre-commit hooks by executing `pre-commit install`.
This will make sure that the checks are passing when you do a commit.

You can also execute the checks by running either `tox -e lint` to only do the linting checks, or `tox` to also execute the tests.

### Running tests

You can run tests on the library by executing `pytest` in the source directory.
This will run the tests against contributed example responses, but you can also execute the tests against a real device:
```
$ pytest --ip <address>
```
Note that this will perform state changes on the device.

### Analyzing network captures

The simplest way to add support for a new device or to improve existing ones is to capture traffic between the mobile app and the device.
After capturing the traffic, you can either use the [softScheck's  wireshark dissector](https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug#wireshark-dissector)
or the `parse_pcap.py` script contained inside the `devtools` directory.
Note, that this works currently only on kasa-branded devices which use port 9999 for communications.


## Supported devices

In principle, most kasa-branded devices that are locally controllable using the official Kasa mobile app work with this library.

The following lists the devices that have been manually verified to work.
**If your device is unlisted but working, please open a pull request to update the list and add a fixture file (use `devtools/dump_devinfo.py` to generate one).**

### TP-Link Tapo support

This library has recently added a limited supported for devices that carry Tapo branding.
That support is currently limited to the cli.  The package `kasa.tapo` is in flux and if you
use it directly you should expect it could break in future releases until this statement is removed.
