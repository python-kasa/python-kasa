python-kasa is a Python library to control TPLink smart home devices (plugs, wall switches, power strips, and bulbs) using asyncio.
This project is a maintainer-made fork of [pyHS100](https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100) project.

## Getting started

You can install the most recent release using pip. Until
```
pip install python-kasa --pre
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and use poetry to install the development version:
```
git clone https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa.git
cd python-kasa/
poetry install
```

## Discovering devices

After installation, the devices can be discovered either by using `kasa discover` or by calling `kasa` without any parameters.

```
$ kasa
No --bulb nor --plug given, discovering..

```

Use `kasa --help` to get list of all available commands, or alternatively, [consult the documentation](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html).

## Basic controls

All devices support a variety of common commands, including:
 * `state` which returns state information
 * `on` and `off` for turning the device on or off
 * `emeter` (where applicable) to return energy consumption information
 * `sysinfo` to return raw system information

## Energy meter

Passing no options to `emeter` command will return the current consumption.
Possible options include `--year` and `--month` for retrieving historical state,
and reseting the counters is done with `--erase`.

```
$ kasa emeter
== Emeter ==
Current state: {'total': 133.105, 'power': 108.223577, 'current': 0.54463, 'voltage': 225.296283}
```

## Bulb-specific commands

At the moment setting brightness, color temperature and color (in HSV) are supported depending on the device.
The commands are straightforward, so feel free to check `--help` for instructions how to use them.

# Library usage

You can find several code examples in [the API documentation](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io).

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! To simplify the process, we are leveraging automated checks and tests for contributions.

### Setting up development environment

To get started, simply clone this repository and initialize the development environment.
We are using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management, so after cloning the repository simply execute
`poetry install` which will install all necessary packages and create a virtual environment for you.

### Code-style checks

We use several tools to automatically check all contributions. The simplest way to verify that everything is formatted properly
before creating a pull request, consider activating the pre-commit hooks by executing `pre-commit install`.
This will make sure that the checks are passing when you do a commit.

You can also execute the checks by running either `tox -e lint` to only do the linting checks, or `tox` to also execute the tests.

### Analyzing network captures

The simplest way to add support for a new device or to improve existing ones is to capture traffic between the mobile app and the device.
After capturing the traffic, you can either use the [softScheck's  wireshark dissector](https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug#wireshark-dissector)
or the `parse_pcap.py` script contained inside the `devtools` directory.
